Physics for scientists and engineers 5th edition
### The unit of mass (kg) is defined as the mass of a specific platinium-iriduim alloy
### The unit of time (s) is defined as 9192631770 times the period of vibration of radiation from the cesium-133 atom
### All matter consists of atoms, and each atom is made up of electrons surrounding a central nucleus. Two entities occupy the nucleus, protons and neutrons. These are made up of quarks.
### Density is the amount of mass contained in a unit volume. œÅ = m/V
### mass of atom = molar mass/ avogadro's number
##### Avogadro's number = 6.02 * 10^23
## Two quantities: Scalar and vector
### plane polar coordinates(r, theta)
### x = r cos(theta), y = r sin(theta), tan (theta) = y/x, (theta) = arctan(y/x), r = sqr(x^2 + y^2) 
##### theta is + counterclockwise
### A scalar quantity is specified by a single value with an appropriate unit and has no direction. Example: Mass, speed, energy, power
### A vector quantity has both magnitude and direction. Example: Force, fields, momentum, torque, velocity.
### Two vectors are said to be equal if there magnitude and direction are the same
### A unit vector is a dimensionless vector having a magnitude of exactly 1. Vector quantites are expressed in terms of unit vectors. i for x axis, j for y axis, k for z axis
